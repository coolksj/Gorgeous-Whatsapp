The WhatsApp lib

    Yowsup is no longer updated. There is no WhatsApp library available, but many people need it. I will gradually open source the library I have used for a long time. This library is written in Java. Will include all features except registration. Because the registration part is not in the scope of this open source.
# If this code is useful for you, please give me a STAR



# How to log in
